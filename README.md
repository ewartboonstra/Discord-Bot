# Discord-Bot

Do you have an anoying friend in discord who can't keep his hands of his soundboard? Then this bot is for you!
Just say in chat mute *person* en he will be muted for a selected period of time. It even supports customs commands like "*person* hou je smoel".

It's amazing

Just rename env.example.py to env.py and fill out the blanks, or customise it to your liking
